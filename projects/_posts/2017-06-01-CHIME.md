CHIME is a method for **C**lustering **HI**gh-dimensional Gaussian **M**ixtures with the **E**M algorithm. The optimization is based on the popular EM algorithm and a direct estimation method for the sparse discriminant vector. CHIME is implemented in Matlab. 

Details on the method implemented are available [here](/papers/cai-chime).
