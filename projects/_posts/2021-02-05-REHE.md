REHE is a method for estimating variance components in linear mixed models. REHE is implemented in R. By resorting to the restricted Haseman-Elston regression, REHE is computationally more efficient than the restricted maximum likelihood. 

For details of the method, please see [here](/papers/yue-REHE).
