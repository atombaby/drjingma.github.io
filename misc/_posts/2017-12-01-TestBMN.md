Note
-----
 - This package also implements one-sample testing of high-dimensional binary Markov networks, which is a straightforward modification of the two-sample test. Details on the method implemented are available [here](/papers/ma-bmn).
 - For related work on testing Gaussian Markov random fields, please see work by my collaborators [here](http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~tcai/paper/Testing-Differential-Network.pdf).
